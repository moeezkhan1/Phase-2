# Airbnb Clone

A React application inspired by the Airbnb homepage, showcasing listings, categories, and search functionality. The app is responsive and built using React hooks for state management.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to launch the app locally

## Design Decisions

- Used functional components for simplicity and clarity
- CSS modules are used for scoped styles
- `useState` is used for managing search input and categories
- `useEffect` would handle fetching mock listing data (if connected to API)
